        <summary>Answer</summary>
    <blockquote>
        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

        <summary>Answer</summary>
    <blockquote>
        JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages. From refreshing social media feeds to displaying animations and interactive maps, JavaScript functions can improve a website's user experience. As a client-side scripting language, it is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. For example, when browsing the internet, anytime you see an image carousel, a click-to-show dropdown menu, or dynamically changing element colors on a webpage, you see the effects of JavaScript.
