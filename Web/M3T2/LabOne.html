    <p>Sai Pallavi was born on 9 May 1992[6] in a Badaga Hindu family[7] in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu.[8] Her hometown is Kotagiri in the Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu.[9] Born to Senthamarai Kannan and Radha, She has a younger sister, Pooja Kannan, who has also worked as an actress.[10][11] She was raised and educated in Coimbatore, doing her schooling at Avila Convent School.[12][13]</p>
    <p>Despite completing her medical studies in 2016 from the Tbilisi State Medical University which is recognised by Medical Council of India, she has not yet registered as a medical practitioner in India.[14] She took her Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) on 31 August 2020 in Trichy.[15] Besides Badaga, Pallavi can speak fluently in Tamil, English, Hindi and Georgian. She later learnt Telugu following a career in her respective cinema industry.[16]</p>
    <p>Pallavi said in an interview that though she was not a trained dancer, but she always wanted to do something that involved dancing.[17] She participated in several cultural events at school, gaining popularity as a dancer. Due to her passion for dance, which was supported by her mother, she participated in the dance reality show Ungalil Yaar Adutha Prabhu Deva on Vijay TV in 2008, and was a finalist in Dhee Ultimate Dance Show (D4) on ETV in 2009.[18][19][20]</p>
